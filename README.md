# Fortune Global 500 - Bar Chart Race

Link to Medium article: https://towardsdatascience.com/the-fortune-500-bar-chart-race-9612dc9d0e63

**Introduction**  
Companies rise and fall amidst the intense and ruthless global competition, thus it would be fascinating to visualize the progress of the top global firms over the past few decades

The Fortune Global 500 is an annual ranking of the top 500 corporations worldwide as measured by revenue, and it serves as a good source of data for running visual analysis. I figured it would also be an enriching learning experience to create animations (like a bar chart race) using code (Python) and no-code (Flourish) solutions.

- Keen to explore how to create interactive visualizations (in particular, a bar chart race) using code and no-code solutions

**Details**  
- The Jupyter notebook contains the Python code for pre-processing and formating the Fortune Global 500 dataset, as well as the creation of the bar chart race animation using the `bar-chart-race` package
- The notebook also contains code for the data visualization to derive the additional insights of the Fortune 500 lists
- The Flourish bar chart race visualization (public version) can be found here: https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/5287940/
